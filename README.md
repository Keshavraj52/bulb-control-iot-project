# Online Bulb Control IoT Project

Welcome to the **Online Bulb Control** IoT project! This project enables remote control of a smart bulb using the Blynk platform, allowing users to turn the bulb on or off from anywhere via a smartphone or web interface.

---

## Overview

The **Bulb Control IoT Project** leverages the Blynk platform to create a simple, yet powerful, IoT solution for remotely managing a smart light. This project demonstrates the integration of microcontrollers (like Arduino, ESP8266, ESP32) with cloud-based IoT platforms to facilitate real-time device control over the internet.

## Features

- Remote control of the bulb via smartphone app or web interface
- Real-time status updates of the bulb (ON/OFF)
- Easy setup with Blynk platform integration
- Compatible with various microcontrollers (specify if applicable)
- Demonstrates basic IoT connectivity and control concepts
